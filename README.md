# Thinkful
App Title (Pete Thinkful Artist)
About the project: This is a task is to complete the HTML code for Pete's portfolio page. Then you will style the page with CSS. Next, you will use a HTML validator to verify the HTML page for syntax errors. Finally, you will display your work on GitHub.io. The page scaffolding, including the header, footer, and horizontal rule elements, has already been set up for you, so you will need to write HTML to complete only the About, Portfolio, and Contact sections. In your solution, strive to use semantic containers, such as article, section, footer, header, and nav, to structure different parts of the page.
